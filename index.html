        <p style = "text-align:center"> 
          The Covid-19 Pandemic has caused a severe slump in the global economy in 2020. 1 year after suffering from the pandemic,
          most countries are well into the late stages of their respective national recovery plans. The aim of this visualization is to
          investigate the economic health of various regions by analysing 2 variables, <b>unemployment rate and annual GDP growth</b> of each country.
          We will study these factors by analysing the trends and relationship of these varaibles with the Economic Freedom of a country.
          We will use the scores of the various factors of economic freedom released for each country by The Index of Economic Freedom, 
          which is an annual published by The Heritage Foundation, that ranks and scores the application of the 
          principles of Economic Freedom at a societal scale across 184 countries.

        <p style = "text-align:center"> The Index covers 12 quantitative and qualitative factors of economic freedom. 
          These factors can be split into 4 categories, <b>Rule of Law</b> (government integrity, property rights, judicial effectiveness), 
        <b>Government Size</b> (government speanding, tax burden, fiscal health), 
        <b>Regulatory Efficiency</b> (business freedom, labor freedom, monetary freedom), and 
        <b>Open Markets</b> (trade freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom).
        Each factor contributes to the Economic Freedom score received by the country. The weight of each factor differes 
        from country to country.</p>

        <h2 style = "text-align:center"> Unemployment Across the Globe  </h2>
          <p style = "text-align:center">Unemployment is a global issue that plagues all countries. The rate of Unemployment has
          <b>increased over the past few years</b> due to a variety of factors such as the 
          <b>Covid-19 Pandemic, Automation of Jobs and Lack of Education</b>. <b>The Global Rate of Unemployment for 2020 was
          6.47%</b>, which is a large increase from the <b>rate of 2019, which was 5.37%</b>. This is largely due to the 
          emergence of the Covid-19 Pandemic. In 2021, most countries have entered a recovery stage after facing 1 year of the
          pandemic. Regions such <b>South East Asia, and Eastern Europe</b> are reporting Unemployment Rates that are <b>lower</b>
          than the global average in 2020. Regions such as <b>Africa and South America</b> which hit badly economically are still reporting
          <b>high rates on Unemployment</b>. For example, South Africa is reporting a <b>rate of 28.2%</b> in 2021.</p>

      <p>There is <b>positive trend</b> when observing the relationship between a countries unemployment rate and its scores
